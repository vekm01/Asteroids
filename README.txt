How to run
----------

Make sure all files are downloaded and in the same directory. Navigate to directory in command prompt and enter "dotnet run" to run the Asteroids app. Tests are executed and printed. A window should appear with the game running. Hold down arrow up to accelerate and steer using arrow left and right. Press space to shoot. Due to the nature of the DIKU Canvas library, only one key press can be registered at a time. You win if you destroy all the asteroids, and you lose if you get hit by one. Enjoy.

This project was created by myself and two co-students.
